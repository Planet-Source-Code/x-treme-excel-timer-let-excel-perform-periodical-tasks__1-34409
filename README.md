### Description

A friend of mine asked me about how to let excel periodically update

some worksheets containing stock prices. So the first thing I did was

searching the web for a solution in Visual Basic for Applications.

But the only one I found was to use a 3rd party ActiveX timer control

which you have to place onto a userform. Then I found the VBA command

"Application.onTime" and I had an idea.

Here is my solution only utilizing the VBA onTime command. NO need for

ActiveX control or any other 3rd party module.
